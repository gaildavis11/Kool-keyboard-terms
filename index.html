    <!-- PRIVACY POLICY -->
    <section id="privacy">
      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Kool Keyboard (“Kool Keyboard”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it.
          This Privacy Policy explains how Kool Keyboard handles information when you use our iOS application and custom
          keyboard extension (the “App”).
        </p>

        <h3>1. Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Kool Keyboard is a custom iOS keyboard designed to provide an alternative typing layout and customization
          options, including themes and typing settings (such as haptics and key sounds). We built Kool Keyboard with
          privacy as a core principle.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p><strong>We do not collect personal information.</strong> Kool Keyboard does not collect, store, transmit, sell, or share any personal information.</p>

        <p><strong>We do not collect anything you type.</strong> Kool Keyboard does not collect, store, log, transmit, or process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keystrokes</li>
          <li>typed text</li>
          <li>passwords</li>
          <li>credit card numbers</li>
          <li>messages, emails, or any other user input</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Everything you type remains on your device, managed by iOS and the applications you use.</p>

        <h3>3. Keyboard Extension & “Full Access”</h3>
        <p>iOS allows users to enable a setting called “Allow Full Access” for third-party keyboards.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Kool Keyboard does not require Full Access for the keyboard to function.</li>
          <li>If enabled, it is used only to support optional features (such as improved customization/settings availability).</li>
          <li>Even with Full Access enabled, Kool Keyboard does not collect or transmit typed content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not share your data with third parties because we do not collect any user data.</p>

        <h3>5. Analytics & Tracking</h3>
        <p>Kool Keyboard:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>does not use advertising SDKs</li>
          <li>does not perform tracking across apps or websites</li>
          <li>does not build user profiles</li>
          <li>does not use your typing input for analytics</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Kool Keyboard does not knowingly collect any personal data from children. Since we do not collect user data at
          all, no personal information is processed.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Security</h3>
        <p>
          Although Kool Keyboard does not collect or store user data, we still take reasonable measures to ensure the App
          operates securely and reliably.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and/or on our
          official Privacy Policy page. The “Last updated” date will also be revised.
        </p>
